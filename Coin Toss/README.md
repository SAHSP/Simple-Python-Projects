# 🪙 Coin Toss Game 🎲

Welcome to the **Coin Toss Game**! This is a simple Python-based game where you get to guess the outcome of a coin flip: either **Heads** or **Tails**. Can you predict the correct result?

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game will prompt you to guess either "heads" or "tails".
2. A virtual coin will be flipped, and the result will be randomly generated.
3. If your guess matches the coin's outcome, you get a point!
4. The game is played over a set number of rounds (default: 5 rounds).
5. Your score is displayed after each round, and your final score is shown at the end.

## 🛠 Features

- Play 5 rounds of coin tossing.
- Input validation for correct guesses ("heads" or "tails").
- Keeps track of your score.
- Simple and interactive command-line interface.
